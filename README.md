# Car Class

This project aims to create a `Car` class. This class includes basic properties of a car and employs encapsulation to validate the number of doors.

## Features

- **Brand**: Specifies the brand of the car.
- **Model**: Specifies the model of the car.
- **Color**: Specifies the color of the car.
- **Number of Doors**: Specifies the number of doors on the car. This property can only be set to 2 or 4. If an invalid value is provided, it will be set to -1, and a warning message will be displayed to the user.
